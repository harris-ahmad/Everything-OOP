Object-Oriented (OO) Software Development has been around since the early 1960s. Back then, people working in tech and software development were trying to find ways to make software development more efficient and less error-prone. The idea of OO was to create a system that would allow for the creation of software that could be reused and maintained more easily. OO is a way of thinking about software development that has been around for a long time, and it is still used today. It was not until the 1990s that OO became popular in the mainstream. Today, OO is used in many different programming languages, including C++. 

Believe it or not but the rise of OO methodologies coincides with the emergence of the Internet as an entertainment platform. Precisely, objects well over a network. Once it became obvious that Internet applications were going to be a big deal, it became clear that OO was the way to go about building and designing web-based applications.

As a side note, you will often hear me use the term "concepts" because despite their consistent nature, they continue to evolve which really help set the stage for discussion.

The concepts discussed in this chapter are just as relevant as they were when they were first introduced.

## What are the Fundamental Concepts of OO?

For a language to be considered **fully** object-oriented, it must support the following concepts: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These concepts are the building blocks of OO. They are the foundation upon which all other concepts are built. Wait, what? What about abstraction? What about composition? What about interfaces? What about...? I know, I know. There are a lot of concepts in OO. But, if you think about it, all of these concepts are built on top of the three fundamental concepts.

One of the issues that I struggled with when I was first introduced to OO was how do these theoretical concepts relate directly to the **current** design practices, which is always changing. For example, there has always been debate about inheritance. Does inheritance break encapsulation? Even in the modern day, many developers tend to avoid using inheritance in their OO Design. Why? Because it's not always clear how inheritance should be used. Inheritance is a powerful tool, but it can also be a dangerous one. It's easy to misuse inheritance, and it's hard to know when to use it.

Despite of whether you end up using inheritance in your design choices, it's a critical concept to grasp, regardless.
